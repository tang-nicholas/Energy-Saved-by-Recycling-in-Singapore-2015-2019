# Energy-Saved-by-Recycling-in-Singapore-2015-2019

DataCamp coding challenge - "Energy saved from recycling"

This project seeks to analyze how much energy in kWh Singapore saved in from 2015-2019 by recycling glass, plastics, ferrous metals, and non-ferrous metals.

The resulting pandas DataFrame annual_energy_savings contains the year as index and total energy saved in kWh per year by recycling the four aforementioned materials.
